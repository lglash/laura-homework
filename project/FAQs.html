			<div class='FAQ-text'>FAQ pages have been around for so long that in our experience, customers usually hunt for them. They originated on Usenet groups both as a navigational tool and as stand-alone curated content. E-commerce websites adopted the format, especially since online buyers could not physically examine products or talk to a sales rep. Murals usually are not similar to different works of art. Theyâ€™ve got an alternative function, an alternative kind of influence on your existence of people whom observe these people.We hope the answers below help you out. if they don't, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:webmaster@example.com">Brenda</a>, who works in Accounts but knows so much.</div>

					<div class='question-1'>
					<p class='FAQ-question'>What is the lenght of time spent per project?</p>
					<p>This is great, can you add a beard though? Can you make it look like this clipart I found, or this looks just perfect too. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue. And pimp it out a bit... </p>
					</div>

					<div class='question-2'>
					<p class='FAQ-question'>Which of your products are Commercial Grade?</p>
					<p>It needs to be sleeker. I need more geometry patterns, like 80's ones, squiggly lines like thunder, but with interesting colours. There's all this Chinese text on my site, can you help me out? you will get a lot of free exposure doing this. Low resolution? It looks ok on my screen. I need a website, no frills so it probably can be done super quick, can't it?  </p>
					</div>


					<div class=question-3>
					<p class='FAQ-question'>Can you improve the quality of the blueprints?</p>
					<p>Anyway, the flier should feel like a warm handshake. Mmmmm, exactly like that, but different. We will exceed the clients' expectations and it will be all thanks to you! Yes, you! I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost and way cheaper, you might want to give it another shot.... </p>
					</div>


					<div class=question-4>
					<p class='FAQ-question'>How many drafts of my project  are included on the package?</p>
					<p>This is great, can you add a beard though? Can you make it look like this clipart I found, or this looks just perfect too. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue. And pimp it out a bit... </p>
					</div>

					<div class=question-5>
					<p class='FAQ-question'>Is there a maximum or minimum price?</p>
					<p>This is great, can you add a beard though? Can you make it look like this clipart I found, or this looks just perfect too. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue. And pimp it out a bit... </p>
