# Create a basic application form

### Premise

You are helping a friend who's running an education startup to create a course application form. He just needs it to be functional for an early release, so don't bother about the styling for now.

### Instructions

Using form elements and form controls of your choosing, create a course application form that takes in the following information from the user:

- Personal details
    - Name
    - Gender
    - Email address
    - Phone number
    - Home address
    - Password for account
- Course details
    - Course choice
    - Past experience relating to course
    - Class days preferences (can select multiple, eg. "Mon" + "Wed")
    - Where did you hear about us from?
- Comments

__Notes__

- Like any form, it should also have a submit button at the bottom for the user to submit the data.
- Use the `placeholder` attribute to your advantage in creating a good user experience!
- Try to use each of the available form elements at least once:
    - `<select>` + `<option>`
    - `<select multiple>` + `<option>`
    - `<input type="x">` where `x` can be:
        - text, password, email, etc.
        - radio
        - checkbox
    - `<textarea>`
    - `<button>`
    - `<label>`
