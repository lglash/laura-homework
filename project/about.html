						<p>This is great, can you add a beard though? Can you make it look like this clipart I found, or this looks just perfect too. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue. And pimp it out a bit... Do less with more, can you make it <span>snazzy</span>, so the website doesn't have the theme I was going for. Yep, it looks a bit empty, try to make it all bigger, and remember, everything has to look the same as in here, or better. Can you punch up the fun level on these icons? Can you rework it to make the pizza look more <span>delicious?</span> Nah, could you use a high definition screenshot? We are a non-profit organization, but we are your relatives, so make it pop and do more with less already! oh and also, can you make the logo bigger? Yes, bigger bigger bigger! The logo is too big, start on it today and we will talk about what I want for next time. Everything has to be the better than theirs please, so just do whatever you think, you're the professional, but Brenda from Accounts has some great ideas.</p> 

						<p>Hmmmm... I like it, but... <span>Can the snow look a little warmer?</span> It needs to be sleeker. I need more geometry patterns, like 80's ones, squiggly lines like thunder, but with interesting colours. There's all this Chinese text on my site, can you help me out? you will get a lot of free exposure doing this. Low resolution? It looks ok on my screen. I need a website, no frills so it probably can be done super quick, can't it? <span>How much will it cost</span>, can you help me out with that? Can we have another option? How many can you draft? It would be better to go for a tropical theme: summery, colourful, with like palm trees and stuff. What you've given us is texty, we want sexy. Can the mouse be a palm tree? I can show you a picture of my favourite type. It has all these crazy leaves which look like a fan, I got one. You need to water palm trees so much, and fertilise them too, my water bill is always super high. </p>
						<p>Anyway, the flier should feel like a warm handshake. Mmmmm, <span>exactly</span> like that, but different. We will exceed the clients' expectations and it will be all thanks to you! Yes, you! I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost and way cheaper, you might want to give it another shot... </p>
						<p><span>Is this the best we can do?</span> Thanks for taking the time to make the website, but I already made it in wix, it wasn't that hard! I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost, the solution is out there, it's just copy and pasting code from the internet <span>chop chop chop</span>, you don't actually need to understand the code, silly!</p>
